# AdoptAFriend

## Description of Site
"AdoptAFriend" is a full stack application to help San Franciscans find their new best friend (doge)! 

The site was built with data (doge information) scraped from three dog adoption agency sites in San Francisco (Petsmart, Rocket Dog Rescue, and Humane Society of Silicon Valley) using Cheerio (node package). 

MongoDB was used to store data and allow users to read, write, and delete comments on specific doggos for him/ her to come back to later. 

This site was deployed using Heroku with the mongolab add-on.
